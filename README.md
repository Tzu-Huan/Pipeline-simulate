Your program will have four pipeline registers (IF, ID, EX, MEM, and WB), which you will set up as structures
with a READ and a WRITE version for each.  Each pipeline register's structure will be different and will be 
based on the information being passed from the previous stage (just like in the book and in the real world)

The program will use an array called Main_Mem to simulate a 1K Main Memory and simulated registers, which 
will just be an array of integers called Regs.
